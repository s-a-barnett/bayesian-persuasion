# Reproducing model simulations and comparison fits


## Model simulations (Fig. 3)

To run the RSA model forward under different settings, use the `.py` scripts in `simulations`.

## Model comparisons (Table 1)

To compare the different variants of RSA and A&A models, use the `.slurm` files in `model-comparison/`.
