# RSA Judge Model

`cv-belief-plots.py` generates the predictive model plots for the RSA model based on the MLE parameters as found by the simulation run. The beliefs are read from `judge-beliefs.csv`, generated using `write-judge-beliefs.sh`, which takes in the parameters generated by `../model-comparison/mle_params.py` and prints the beliefs with `judge.wppl`.
